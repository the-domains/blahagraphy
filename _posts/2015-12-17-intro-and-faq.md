Hi, I'm Mike.   People are my passion and capturing them in images is a privelege I don't take lightly.  Heck I'm thrilled to be asked to capture events from the most important day of your life to a intimate family moment.  

Here are some question people frequently ask of me about my photography:

Q: Do you shoot in digital or film?

A: Both!  Typically I'm asked to shoot digital images but LOVE shooing film as well!

Q: How many images do you shoot at a wedding?

A: A whole bunch. 

Q: Do you bring your own equipment? 

A: Oh yeah, and back up gear too!

Q: When can we see our images?

A: I spend a lot of time making sure your images are incredible! Expect 3-4 weeks from the day of the shoot for engagement and portrait sessions and 6-8 weeks for weddings.

Q: Do you shoot destination events?

A: As long as it's not in Antarctica. I just ask for reimbursement for travel expenses (I don't charge for travel time.)

Q: Can we see images from a full wedding?

A: Sure! Just contact me to see some of my most recent work.

Q: Do you use a second photographer?

A: I usually shoot by myself but I have an amazingly talented photographer that I use if a second shooter is important to you.

Q: How do we book you?

A: Just fill out your info in the contact section on my site and expect me get back to you shortly. A retainer of 1/3 of the final package cost and a signed contract is all we need to lock in the date.
